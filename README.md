Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
- The requirements are to create an app that can track the user's weight and activity. The app then will have a user selected goal to achieve and will try to encourage the user to reach these goals. The needs that the app is designed to address are a user who is trying to gain or lose weight. If the user is trying to lose weight, the app helps encourage more activity while providing a calorie tracker to reduce intake. in contrast, the user trying to gain weight will be able to improve activity to help gain muscle whilst also encouraging the user to increase their caloric intake to improve their weight.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
- The screens required to make this app functional were, a login screen, a main screen, and a settings/SMS screen. The UI design was formatted to help the user's attention move from the top of the screen to the bottom. The login page was a standard format with the username and the password entry boxes at the middle of the screen, with the login and sign up buttons large at the bottom. The main screen shows a grid of the user's information at the top, with the ability to change the data on the bottom. I believe that the designs are successful because the user can easily follow the desired order of operations.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
- I struggled with the coding section of this app and still have to finish it. I have been having trouble with the coding language. I have been trying to find walkthroughs of similar programs on youtube and other sites to help solve issues in my code. Most examples are in many different language types compared to my project, so their help is limited.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
- I would start up the app after every change to see if the experience had changed. If the app failed to load, I remove the addition and see if it has resolved the issue. This process is important because it helps point out the exact cause of the issue. it also helps find issues that would otherwise make their way to launch.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
- The most I had to innovate was in the original idea phase. This concept of app design is new to me, so this is where I had to work my hardest to understand the concepts before starting. I did not finish the coding section, so it is the hardest challenge that *I need to face still as I am hoping to finish this project and update this repository accordingly.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
- I believe the UI is my strongest component. I used my past graphical skills to create a simple yet streamlined app that promotes user engagement and ease of use. There are still improvements to be made to this project however, as it is very simple due to the limited timeframe available.
